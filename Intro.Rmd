## Data Scientists task

]

---
## Data Import

- Excel, text files.

- Databases

- Internet: APIS, data scraping

- Devices (GPS, Imaging, etc.)


---
## Data Wrangling

> 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data (Dasu and Johnson 2003)


---
## Modeling

- Stats stuff


---
## Visualize

- Exploratory, interactive visualization.


---
## Communicate

- Communicating your findings effectively to stakeholders is crucial for success of data science.

- R supports multiple ways of presenting your results: blogs, written documents, data visualization and interactive applications.

## Themes
- [Use theming to adhere to styleguides] (https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/)

---
## Interactive applications

https://shiny-eio.upc.edu/pubs/sport-R-packages/

---
## Open Source, reproducibility, et all

- R's strength is its community

- Workshops, blogs, Journals, etc.

# Getting started

## R & RStudio

.pull-left[
![R & RStudio](./imgs/r_rstudio.jpeg) 
]

.pull-right[
- RStudio is a __computing environment__

- R is a __programming language__
]
---
## RStudio

.pull-left[
![RStudio](./imgs/rstudio-panes-labeled.jpeg)
]

.pull-right[
- You do not use a lot of the windows.

- You need to use well the ones you use.
]
---
## RStudio (2)

- Working Directory

- `getwd()`, `setwd()`, `list.files()`.

- `install.packages()`

- Sourcing scripts `.R`

- Opening data files `(.rds)`

---
## R

- Functions and objects

- Variables and assignment

- Side effects


---
## Objects
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)

```

---
## Objects (2) The Data Frame


.pull-left[
- Similar to an Excel spreadsheet (?)

- It has rows and columns

- Each row is an observation

- Each column is a feature of the data
]


.pull-right[
```{r}
mtcars
```
]


???

Ask for examples of data sets.
---
## Functions

The take arguments and return objects and/or produce side effects.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(mtcatrs)
```

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

## Lab: a complete R script


Download it from URL.

- Opens two rds files with data from NBA teams.

- Merges on the `Team` column

- Calculates the mean assits, blocks, steals for the teams that went to the playoffs and the ones that didn't.


---

## TODO

- Open the html file. Do Playoff teams have more points on average?

- What functions does it use?

- Can you identify which function does it support (import, wrangling, model, communication?)?

- What objects does it create?

- How many rows does the `` data frame have?

- Which are the columns?
